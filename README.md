We're diving into an exciting world of collaboration and creativity known as Scrum. This is a way of working that feels like playing your favorite strategy game but with the added thrill of creating awesome digital projects. That's what Scrum is all about!

## Agile Development: The Game-Changer üéÆ
Before we jump into Scrum, let's quickly talk about its origin - Agile Development. Think of Agile as a mindset, a set of values that encourage teamwork, flexibility, and adapting to change. It's like having a superpower that helps you tackle challenges efficiently. In your own time, look more into all of the workings of Agile. For this project we will be working with the Scrum framework of Agile. 

## Scrum: The Winning Playbook üèÜ
Now, let's zoom into Scrum, like I mentioned before, it's specific framework within Agile. Picture it as your game-winning playbook. Scrum breaks down big tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, making teamwork smoother and projects more successful.

## Let's explore the core components:

In the scrum framework there are a few main components that will keep you to move the progress of your product along to completion and iterations. 
* Sprints
  * Stand-up/downs
  * Tickets
    * Categories
  * Scrum board

## Sprint

A sprint is a time-boxed iteration during which a specific set of work is completed. Sprints are a fundamental part of the Scrum framework and are usually short, typically lasting between 1 to 4 weeks. The most common duration for a sprint is two weeks. For this project you'll have much shorter sprints. One to to get to your MVP by 5pm Wednesday and one to get to your final product by 4pm Friday. 

Here are main points of a Sprint:

* Time-Boxed: Sprints have a fixed duration. This time-boxing ensures that the team focuses on delivering a potentially shippable product increment within the specified time frame.

* Planning: Before a sprint begins, there is a Sprint Planning meeting where the team selects a set of work items from the product backlog to be completed during the sprint. The team collaboratively agrees on what can be achieved within the sprint.(Ya'll did this on Monday).

* Daily Standup: During the sprint, the team holds a brief daily meeting called the Daily Standup or Daily Scrum. Team members share progress, discuss any challenges, and plan the work for the next 24 hours.
  *  What Did You Do Yesterday?
  * What Are You Working on Today?
  * Any Impediments or Blockers?

* Review: At the end of the sprint, there is a Sprint Review where the team demonstrates the work completed to stakeholders. This provides an opportunity for feedback and ensures that the product is on track. (Your mamager will help with this part.)

* Retrospective: After the Sprint Review, the team holds a Sprint Retrospective. This meeting is a reflective session where the team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and identifies action items for continuous improvement. (You will do this with your team after your meeting with your manager).

* Incremental Development: The goal of each sprint is to deliver a potentially shippable increment of the product. This means that at the end of every sprint, there is a new version of the product with additional features or improvements.

## Tickets

In the Scrum framework you would usually keep track of the progress of a project/sprint though tickets on a Scrum Board, more on that in just a bit. The tickets would have a user story, task and sub task if needed.

Example: 
  ### As a user foo 1....
  #### Functionality 
  - item 1
    - sub item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
  - item 4

### Category

#### Back_log 
Your to-do list filled with all the tasks that need to be completed at the end of a sprint. Each one of these can be assigned to a person or more.

Example: 
  ### As a user foo 2....
  #### Functionality 
  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
  - item 4

  ### As a user foo 4....
  #### Layout
  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
  - item 4

  and more...

#### In Progress
Tasks actively being worked on. 

Example: 
### As a user foo 3....
#### Layout
  - item 1
  - ‚úÖ item 2 
  - item 3
  - item 4

#### Done : Completed tasks, your victories!

Example: 

### As a user foo 3....
#### Layout
As a user foo 1....
  - ‚úÖ item 1
  - ‚úÖ item 2
  - ‚úÖ item 3
  - ‚úÖ item 4

## ScrumBoard

Let's check out this example the Ben and I made. Ben and I can also Do a little role play of what it looks like to have a stand up.
